              <p class="build-sect-1-body">The gene expression sequences for Ideonella Sakaiensis PETase and MHETase were found
                from previous gene expression studies (<a href="#ref1">1</a>,<a href="#ref2">2</a>). PETase was expressed with a lamB signal peptide from maltoporin 
                protein, promoting a Sec-dependent pathway and localisation to the outer e.coli membrane as this has been shown
                to increase secretion and yield of protein, <a href="#ref3">3</a>. Similar studies could not be found for IsMHETase, thus the protein
                was expressed with its native signal peptide as described in Janatunaim & Fibrani’s 2020 study.<br><br>

                  Vector Builder Sequence Alignment Tool</a>.
                  As the PETase sequence had already been codon-optimised in the Joo. et al 2018 study, only MHETase required codon optimisation which was
                  performed with the <a href="https://eu.idtdna.com/pages/tools/codon-optimization-tool" target="_blank"> IDT Biosciences codon optimisation tool</a>.<br><br></li>

                  <li>Two colonies were selected from each gene plate and incubated individually in 5ml LB broth with Kanamycin, with vigorous shaking at 37ºC overnight.</li>
                  <li>A miniprep was then performed on each of the 4 samples before DNA extract was added to 4 identical liquid E. coli BL21 DE3 cultures and spread over LB agar with Kanamycin and cultured at 37ºC overnight.</li>
                  <li>One plate for each gene was successful; one colony from each successful plate was then cultured in 100ml LB broth with Kanomycin, with vigorous shaking at 37ºC overnight.</li>
                  <li>Each culture was then made up to 1L and grown to an optical density of 0.6 and 0.8, after approximately 90 minutes.</li>
